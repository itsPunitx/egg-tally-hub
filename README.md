# 🥚 Egg Sales Tracker (But Not Just for Eggs!)

## 📌 About the Project
Egg Sales Tracker is a simple and mobile-friendly web app built to make selling (and keeping track of what you’ve sold) super easy.  

It was originally designed for hostel students and small sellers to record **egg sales**, payments, stock, and profits — but hey, you can totally use it for **anything else you sell** too!  
🍅 Vegetables, 🥛 Milk, 📚 Books, 🎧 Gadgets… you name it.  

Every user gets their own private dashboard where they can:
- Record sales instantly  
- Track who owes money 👀  
- Manage your stock/inventory  
- Get clean analytics on sales, revenue, and profit  

And yes—it all comes with a sleek **dark theme** for a modern, smooth user experience.
